# Zesty Local React Example

## What is this?

This is an example project that demonstrates how to use React to load data from a Zesty.io instance **(storing the data locally)**. This repository was created using the popular [Create-React-App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is intended to be an example. 

Files to note (they pull data from Zesty.io, using an example Zesty instance, [Zesty Burger](http://burger.zesty.site))

	zesty.yaml # this is the file you configure to specify what data you want
	src/data/ # this contains the files generated by zesty
	src/Home.js
	src/Menu.js

## How do I run the demo on my system?

This is created through `create-react-app`, so

	# clone the repository
	npm install # use yarn if you want
	npm start
